# eloquentjs
This is a repository for my personal notes on the book "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke. 
For each chaper, beginning with chpter three I have one file for notes and one file for my solutions to the exercises.
My goal while working through this book over the next month or so is to become very confident with vallila JavaScript. 
I've already completed Harvard's CS50 on edX, so I understand the basics of progamming, but I hope to get to know js more inimately.
I hope this repository can serve as a future reference for projects that use JavaScript,
as well as a foundation to understand frameworks like React, Vue or Angular. All of which I need to learn more aobut.
